## 1. Identify Real-Life Objects with OOP Concepts

Pick any 3 real-life objects (e.g., smartphone, bicycle, school), and for each:

- List at least 3 properties (attributes).
- List at least 3 behaviors (methods).
- Write which OOP principle each property or behavior best represents and why.

## 2. Draw a Diagram of an OOP Modeled System

Create a diagram (hand-drawn or digital) of a system like:

- A library system (Books, Members, Staff, etc.)
- Or a fast-food restaurant system (Orders, Menus, Employee)
  In the diagram Show classes/objects

- Arrows to represent relationships like inheritance or composition
- Indicate which class encapsulates what data and methods

## 3. Explain OOP Principles with Human Analogies

Write your own analogy (non-code) to explain each of the 5 OOP principles:

- Abstraction
- Encapsulation
- Inheritance
- Polymorphism
- Composition

It must be unique (not from the class), and explain how that analogy relates to programming.

## 4. Compare OOP vs Functional Thinking

Choose a simple system (e.g., a To-Do app or Alarm Clock) and:

- Describe how you’d design it using OOP (with objects)
- Describe how you’d design it using Functional Programming (with functions)

You don’t have to write code — just use words and bullets.

## 5. Object vs Class vs Function – Explain Like a Teacher

Imagine you’re teaching a 10-year-old:

- What is a Class?
- What is an Object?
- What is a Function?

Use simple language, drawings, or emojis if needed.
