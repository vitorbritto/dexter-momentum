# Tasks

## 1. Find the Most Frequent Word in a Paragraph

Consider the follwoing HTML:

```html
<div id="text">This is a test. This test is only a test.</div>
```

Now, find and display the most frequently occurring word. Also put a count of occurance beside it.

Hints:

- Use document.querySelector() or getElementById() to select the paragraph.
- Convert the text into an array of words.
- Use querySelector() to display the most frequent word along with the count inside another `<div>`.

## 2. Create a zebra pattern

Consider the following HTML:

```html
<ul id="cars">
  <li>BMW</li>
  <li>Mahindra</li>
  <li>Audi</li>
  <li>Toyota</li>
  <li>Honda</li>
  <li>Hundai</li>
  <li>Tata</li>
  <li>Suzuki</li>
</ul>
```

Now put alternate colors and background colors to each of the list tags. for example,

- If tne BMW is in white color text, the background should be in black color.
- Then for the next car it will be reversed, the color is black and the background is white.
- Then again the next one is white color and background black
- So on.

## 3. Write different ways we can access DOM and what they returns

## 4. Find and Replace Text Inside a Page
