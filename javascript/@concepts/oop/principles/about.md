# Principles

## Abstraction - Hide Complexity and expose interface

The process of hidding the internal complexities of how something works and only exposing what's necessary for the user to interact with.

## Encapsulation - Restrict Access to Data

It's the bundle of data and methods that work on that data and restrict the access to the data from outside.

## Inheritance - Share logic between classes

It's the ability to inherit properties and methods from a parent class.

## Polymorphism - Same method, with different behaviors

It's the ability to take different forms.

## Composition - Combine objects to create new objects

It's the ability to compose objects from other objects.
