# Tasks

## 1. Create a table of two columns, `situation` and `value`. Now add the rows for every situations and the value of `this` in that situation. Please cover the following situations

- At the Global
- Inside an Object Method
- Inside the Satandalone non-Arrow Function
- Inside an Arrow Function(standalone)
- Inside an Arrow Function(as object method)
- Inside an object created with the Constructor Function

Please add examples for each of the scenarios.

## 2. What is the problem here? Fix it to log the correct name and explain the fix

```js
const user = {
  name: "javaScript",
  greet: () => {
    console.log(`Hello, ${this.name}!`);
  },
};

user.greet();
```

## 3. Can you explain what is the problem here and fix the issue to log the correct name?

```js
const obj = {
  name: "Tom",
  greet: function () {
    console.log(`Hello, ${this.name}!`);
  },
};

const greetFn = obj.greet;
greetFn();
```

## 4. What is the problem with the following code? Why isn't it logging the name correctly?

```js
const user = {
  name: "Alex",
  greet: function () {
    function inner() {
      console.log(`Hello, ${this.name}!`);
    }
    inner();
  },
};

user.greet();
```

## 5. Create a `Sports` constructor function that takes `name` and `number of players` as arguments and assigns them using `this` keyword. Then, create two sports instances and log their details

## 6. Can you attach the car1's `describe()` method to car2 object? Give all possible solutions that you can think of

```js
const car1 = {
  brand: "Audi",
  model: "A8",
  describe: function () {
    console.log(`This car is a ${this.brand} ${this.model}.`);
  },
};

const car2 = {
  brand: "BMW",
  model: "X1",
};
```

## 7. What will be the output of the following code and why?

```js
const person = {
  name: "Charlie",
  sayHello: function () {
    console.log(this.name);
  },
  sayHelloArrow: () => {
    console.log(this.name);
  },
};

person.sayHello();
person.sayHelloArrow();
```

Options are:

- A: "Charlie" and "Charlie"
- B: "Charlie" and undefined
- C: "Charlie" and "" (empty string)
- D: undefined and "Charlie"
