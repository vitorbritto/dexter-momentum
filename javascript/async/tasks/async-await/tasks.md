# Tasks

## 1. Create a function wait(ms) that returns a promise which resolves after ms milliseconds. Use async/await to log messages before and after the delay

## 2. Using async/await, log "One", then after 1 second log "Two", then "Three" after another 2 seconds. No setTimeout outside of promises

## 3. Use fetch() with async/await to load a local JSON file (data.json) and display its contents in the console

## 4. Use the public API `https://jsonplaceholder.typicode.com/users/1` to fetch and display the user’s name, email, and address on the page

## 5. Modify the previous task to handle errors (e.g., wrong URL) and display a user-friendly error message in the DOM

## 6. Refactor then/catch to async/await

```js
fetch("/api/data")
  .then((res) => res.json())
  .then((data) => console.log(data))
  .catch((err) => console.error(err));
```

## Project Task

Let's Build a “Movie Explorer” App

Build an app that lets users search movies using the OMDB API:
`http://www.omdbapi.com/?apikey=yourkey&s=movieName`

Hints:

- Input box for search term
- Display movie title, poster, and year
- Show “No results found” if search fails
- Use async/await, DOM manipulation, and try/catch
