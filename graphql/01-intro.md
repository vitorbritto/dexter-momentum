# Introduction to GraphQL

## What is GraphQL?

GraphQL is a query language for APIs and a runtime for fulfilling those queries with your existing data. GraphQL provides a complete and understandable description of the data in your API, gives clients the power to ask for exactly what they need and nothing more, makes it easier to evolve APIs over time, and enables powerful developer tools.

## Why use GraphQL?

GraphQL is a modern alternative to REST APIs. It allows you to query your data in a more flexible and efficient way.

Here are some of the benefits of using GraphQL:

- **Overfetching:** Fetching more data than you need.
- **Underfetching:** Fetching less data than you need.
- **Orchestration:** GraphQL allows you to orchestrate your data fetching in a more flexible way.

## How does GraphQL work?

The Front-end requests something using the request method POST to the GraphQL endpoint. Then, the GraphQL server communicates with the Back-end to get the data. Finally, the GraphQL server returns the data to the Front-end.
