# Introduction

## What is the role of a Front-end Developer?

The Front-end Developer will be responsible for creating the user interface of a website to ensure it is visually appealing and easy to use, with a strong focus on design principles and user experience. You will work closely with designers, back-end developers, and project managers to ensure the final product meets client needs and provides the best possible experience for end users.

## What languages are used in Front-end Development?

The easy part about the front-end developer role is that there aren't as many language and technology options (unlike back-end development).

As a front-end developer, you will work with the following technologies:

- HTML (Hypertext Markup Language): The markup language used to create the page structure. All information you want to display on a web page will be organized through HTML.
- CSS (Cascading Style Sheets): The cascading style sheet language allows you to adjust how HTML elements are rendered, improving the visual appearance of your page.
- JavaScript: The standard programming language for the front-end, which allows you to add dynamism to your websites or web applications. There is an alternative called TypeScript, which is a typed superset of JavaScript. However, in this case, you'll need to configure a transpiler to convert your code to JavaScript before running it in the browser.

## What skills are needed for a Front-end developer?

The main skills needed to become a front-end developer are HTML, CSS, and JavaScript. The others are also important, but without these three basics, it's not possible to apply any of the others.

The complete list of skills you should consider to evolve as a front-end developer is as follows:

1. Understanding of core technologies: HTML, CSS, and JavaScript.
2. Accessibility: Knowing how this can affect user experience.
3. Version control: Being familiar with tools like Git.
4. Responsive design: Implementing layouts that adapt to different devices and screen sizes.
5. User experience (UX): Understanding basic UX principles.
6. SEO: Knowing how search engine optimization works and how to apply it in code.
7. RESTful APIs: Understanding basic concepts and how to consume them.
8. Testing and debugging: Applying testing practices and debugging efficiently.
9. Developer tools: Mastering browser DevTools to inspect, debug, and optimize code.
10. Frameworks: Having a main framework for use (like React or Vue) and knowing others in general.
11. Web Performance: Understanding performance optimizations and metrics like Web Vitals.
12. TypeScript: Knowing how it works and when to use it.

Mastering these basic skills will prepare you for any front-end job interview and will also improve your performance in your current role.

## Is Front-end Development really programming?

Do front-end developers really program? The answer is yes, absolutely.

The fact that front-end developers produce visual output (thanks to designs created by others) sometimes confuses some people, leading them to think that front-end isn't real programming. But this is far from reality.

As a front-end developer, you will be coding all the time.

Although in some companies the front-end developer also acts as a designer or UX engineer, this is not the typical profile. Your learning focus should be oriented towards code ‚Äî that is, good programming practices, software design patterns, front-end architecture, among others.
