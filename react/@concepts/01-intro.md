# What is React?

- React is a JavaScript UI Library for building user interfaces. It was created and maintaned by Facebook.
- The User Interfaces are looked at in terms of components.
- React is currently the most popular out of the major front-end frameworks.
- Often related as a Framework because it operates like one.

# Why React?

Back in a day, websites would need to load a new page when the user would click on a link or button. This was the state of the web for a long time and a problem because it would cause the page to reload and the user would lose their progress.

Later on, people started to use AJAX to update the page without reloading the page. This was a good solution, but it was not a good user experience because the page would still reload and the user would lose their progress.

React allows us to create a SPA (Single Page Application) which allows us to load the page once and then update the page with new content without reloading the page. This is a much better user experience because the page does not reload and the user does not lose their progress.

## Points to highlight

- It's a dynamic and interactive way to build user interfaces.
- Very fast, especially when using the new compiler (React 19, replacing the Virtual DOM).
- There is a huge ecossystem from Next.js to React Native.
- Best framework to learn to get a job.
- Build system with Vanilla JS was a pain point and code would become a mess.
