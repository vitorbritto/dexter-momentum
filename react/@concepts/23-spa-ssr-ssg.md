# SPA, SSR and SSG

There are different ways to render a React application in the browser.

These are:

- SPA (Single Page Application)
- SSR (Server Side Rendering)
- SSG (Static Site Generation)

## üì¶ SPA (Single Page Application)

A SPA is a web application that loads a single HTML page and then updates the page with new content without reloading the page.

### Pros

- Fast client-side navigation (no full page reloads)
- Smooth, app-like user experience
- Easier to manage state and UI transitions
- Can work offline with service workers
- Typically simpler deployment (just static files)

### Cons

- Slower initial load (JavaScript bundle must be downloaded and parsed)
- Poorer SEO out of the box (content is rendered client-side)
- Content may not be visible if JavaScript is disabled
- Can be less performant on low-end devices or slow networks

## üì¶ SSR (Server Side Rendering)

A SSR is a web application that renders the HTML on the server side and then sends the HTML to the client side.

### Pros

- Faster initial page load compared to SPA
- Better SEO, since content is rendered on the server and crawled by search engines
- Content is visible even if JavaScript is disabled
- Improved performance for users on slow networks or devices

### Cons

- More complex setup and infrastructure required (need a server to render pages)
- Slower page transitions compared to SPA, as each navigation may require a new server request
- Increased server load, since every request may trigger a render
- Some client-side interactivity may be harder to implement or require extra work

## üì¶ SSG (Static Site Generation)

React generates static HTML files at build time and then serves them to the client. These are very fast to load and have a good SEO score.

### Pros

- Very fast initial page load, as content is already in the HTML
- Excellent SEO, since content is rendered on the server and crawled by search engines
- Content is visible even if JavaScript is disabled
- Improved performance for users on slow networks or devices

### Cons

- Not as flexible as SSR or SPA, as the content is static and can't be easily updated
- Requires more infrastructure to handle dynamic content
- Can't work offline with service workers
- More complex deployment (need to rebuild the site to update content)

## üìù Summary

- SPA is best for dynamic, client-side applications
- SSR is best for SEO-focused websites
- SSG is best for static content that doesn't need to be updated frequently
