# JSX (JavaScript Syntax Extension)

JSX is a syntax extension for JavaScript that allows you to write HTML-like code in your JavaScript files.

It is used to describe the UI of your application.

## How it works

JSX is compiled into JavaScript using a compiler like Babel.

## Types of JSX

- Functional components
- Class components
- Hooks (useState, useEffect, useContext, useReducer, etc.)
- Higher-order components
- Render props (useImperativeHandle, useLayoutEffect, useMemo, useCallback, etc.)
- Compound components

## How to use it

```js
const element = <h1>Hello, world!</h1>;
```
