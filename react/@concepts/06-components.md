# Components

Components are the building blocks of React. They are reusable pieces of UI that can be composed together to create more complex UIs.

Also, the components can get props passed in and can hold their own state.

## Types of components

- Functional components
- Class components
- Hooks (useState, useEffect, useContext, useReducer, etc.)
- Higher-order components
- Render props (useImperativeHandle, useLayoutEffect, useMemo, useCallback, etc.)
- Compound components

## In Summary

- They are the building blocks of any React application (such as buttons, inputs, and pages).
- Each component is a JavaScript function that returns _JSX_.
- JSX is a syntax similar to HTML, but in practice it’s JavaScript in disguise.
- Only one parent element can be returned — if multiple are needed, use React.Fragment.
