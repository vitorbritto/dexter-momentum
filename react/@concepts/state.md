# State

State represents the data that a component manages internally and can be changed by the user or by the component itself.

This could be things like:

- The current count of a counter
- The current value of an input
- The current state of a form
- The current state of a modal

There is also global state, which relates to the App as a whole and not a single component.

## Types of state

- Local state (useState, useReducer)
- Global state (useContext)
- Server state (useQuery, useMutation)
- URL state (useSearchParams)
