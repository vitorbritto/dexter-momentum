# Components

Components are the building blocks of React. They are reusable pieces of UI that can be composed together to create more complex UIs.

Also, the components can get props passed in and can hold their own state.

## Types of components

- Functional components
- Class components
- Hooks (useState, useEffect, useContext, useReducer, etc.)
- Higher-order components
- Render props (useImperativeHandle, useLayoutEffect, useMemo, useCallback, etc.)
- Compound components
