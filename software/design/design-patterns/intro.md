# Introduction to Design Patterns

Design patterns are general solutions to common problems that arise in software development. They provide a way to describe and communicate proven solutions to common design problems and they provide a common vocabulary for design. They are not specific to any particular programming language or technology, but rather describe the problem and the solution in a way that can be applied to many different contexts.

There are several different types of design patterns, including:

- **Creational**: The design patterns that deal with the creation of an object.
- **Structural**: The design patterns in this category deal with the class structure such as Inheritance and Composition.
- **Behavioral**: This type of design patterns provides solutions for the better interaction between objects, promoting loose coupling, and flexibility to extend easily in future.
- **Architectural**: The design patterns in this category deal with the overall structure of the software system, trying to create a more flexible and maintainable architecture.
